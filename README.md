# GroceryCompare
A web app to find the cheapest groceries for your needs.

The user inputs their budget, the stores they want to select from (Woolworths and Coles), the items they want, and the minimum amounts of each item they want. From there the web app outputs the best deals for the selected items at which store, and gives the name of the item, its price, quantity and how much of their budget they used along with how much they have remaining
